# Whack-A-Mole

Let's create a simple Whack-A-Mole clone.
The goal of this traditional game is to prevent "moles" from coming out the ground with a hammer. Every second a new "mole" appears and you'll have to click on it to gently tell her to go back into the soil where it belongs. Everytime you click on a mole, your score increases.
